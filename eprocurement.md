<!-- TITLE: eProcurement -->

**eProcurement** is Vanderbilt's interface for ordering products.

The general workflow is as follows:
1. The **creator** (that's you) creates a requisition for one or more products. This is sent to the approver.
2. The **approver** ([someone from the department](/admin-asst#bethany-oates)) reviews the order for accuracy and necessity for the specified projects. Once approved, it is sent to the buyer.
3. The **buyer** actually creates the purchase order (PO) and submits it, via email or fax, to the supplier (the company which sells the product).
4. The **supplier** receives the order and ships the products to the lab.

On average, it takes about 2 days from the time you submit the requisition to the time the supplier receives the order, so keep that in mind when you need a product to be shipped. It's usually better to get orders in as soon as you know about them. However, if you need something approved right away or you feel like they're taking too long, feel free to email [the approver](/admin-asst#bethany-oates) to remind them to check on requisitions pending their approval.
