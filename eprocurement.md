<!-- TITLE: eProcurement -->

**eProcurement** is Vanderbilt's interface for ordering products. It can be accessed via [this link](https://webapp.mis.vanderbilt.edu/asap/Worklist.action) or by [searching "vanderbilt eprocurement" on Google](https://www.google.com/search?q=vanderbilt+eprocurement).

The general workflow is as follows:
1. The **creator** (that's you) creates a requisition for one or more products. This is sent to the approver.
2. The **approver** ([someone from the department](/admin-asst#bethany-oates)) reviews the order for accuracy and necessity for the specified projects. Once approved, it is sent to the buyer.
3. The **buyer** (someone in the VUMC purchasing department) actually creates the purchase order (PO) and submits it, via email or fax, to the supplier (the company which sells the product).
4. The **supplier** receives the order and ships the products to the lab.

On average, it takes about 2 days from the time you submit the requisition to the time the supplier receives the order, so keep that in mind when you need a product to be shipped. It's usually better to get orders in as soon as you know about them. However, if you need something approved right away or you feel like they're taking too long, feel free to email [the approver](/admin-asst#bethany-oates) to remind them to check on requisitions awaiting their approval.
# Regular requisition

# eCatalog requisition
eCatalogs are vendor sites that are configured to interface with the eProcurement system (this interface is known as a "punchout"), so you don't have to type in all the product information yourself.

On the top menu bar of the eProcurement home screen, click on **Shop eCatalogs**. This will take you to a very ugly page with a list of company logos on the right side.


Click on the company that you'd like to order from. This will bring you to that vendor's punchout site.  
> If the vendor's punchout gives a message like "You are logged out", it's probably not going to work. To fix it, go back to the vendor selection page, or just start completely over.


Most vendors' punchouts have a search bar where you can search by the name of the product or by the product code. Use that to find the product that you'd like to order.


Enter the quantity that you'd like to order and press add to cart. If you've ever shopped for anything online, this should conjure up fond memories.

Go to your shopping cart. This will have a summary of all the stuff you've added to the cart so far. Check to make sure it's all correct, and then press **Return to punchout application** or **Submit** or something that seems like it will do that. They're all slightly different.

This will bring you back to a very ugly page with yet another summary of your order. Press **CHECKOUT** at the bottom.

This will bring you back into the normal eProcurement page. From here on out, it will be exactly the same as submitting a [regular requisition](/eprocurement#regular-requisition), except that all the product-related information will be pre-filled.
