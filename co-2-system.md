<!-- TITLE: CO2 System -->

The CO<sub>2</sub> system supplies the [incubator](/incubator-system "Incubator System") with carbon dioxide. Cells grown in the incubator need the media to be kept at an optimal pH (around 7). Typically media contains dissolved bicarbonate (HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>) in order to maintain this pH, but at normal air concentrations of CO<sub>2</sub>, the bicarbonate would dissociate to H<sub>2</sub>O and CO<sub>2</sub> and evaporate into the air. Therefore, in order to keep the media at the correct pH, the atmosphere in the incubator is kept at 5% CO<sub>2</sub> to keep the bicarbonate in solution.

# Reading the gauges
The tanks each have a regulator on them, as pictured. The regulator controls how fast the gas is allowed to escape from the tank.

![tank regulator](/uploads/co-2-system/co-2-system-00006-a.jpg "tank regulator")

The regulator has two gauges:  
* **Regulator pressure gauge**: indicates the pressure of the gas leaving the regulator, into the tank switcher. This should be around 10 psi (lbs/in). Adjust this using the pressure regulator knob.  
* **High pressure gauge**: indicates the amount of gas remaining in the tank. When this reads zero, the tank is empty!

The regulator has two knobs:  
* **Pressure regulator knob**: controls the pressure of the gas leaving the regulator.
* **Regulator outlet knob**: when closed, prevents gas from leaving the regulator. When open, allows gas to leave the regulator. You most likely will not have to adjust this one.

The tanks themselves also have a knob, the **cylinder valve**, which when closed, prevents the gas from leaving the tank. If you want to turn off a tank, use this knob.
# Tank switcher
The tank switcher serves as an intermediary between the tanks and the incubator. 

When one of the tanks runs out, the tank switcher automatically switches to the other tank to keep the flow of CO<sub>2</sub> constant. 

![tank switcher front](/uploads/co-2-system/co-2-system-00010-a.jpeg "tank switcher front")

The front of the tank switcher has two sets of lights (a set for each tank) and a switch in the middle.
* The **pressure light** blinks green when that tank is the one actively being used. It is solid green when that tank has pressure but is not currently being used.
* The **tank empty light** is solid red when that tank is empty.
* The **on/off switch** switches the power of the tank switcher. Turning off the switcher *does not* stop the flow of gas - it simply continues letting gas through the tank that was last selected when the switcher was powered off.

The tank switcher will sound an alarm when one tank runs out. To turn off this alarm, simply switch the on/off switch off and then back on.

The back of the tank switcher has three quick-release ports, two for the tanks and one as the output. These are all size 1/4-inch (6mm) OD.

The model of the tank switcher is [TREG-SO1 SwitchOver CO2 Cylinder Automatic Backup Switcher from Tritech Research](http://www.tritechresearch.com/TREG-SO1.html).
# Ordering replacement tanks
When one of the tanks has run out, you'll need to order a replacement.

We rely on **A&L Compressed Gas** for our CO<sub>2</sub>.  
>A&L Compressed Gas  
>615.254.1457

Call them and tell them you are calling from Vanderbilt University and that you need to order a CO<sub>2</sub> tank.

They commonly ask several questions, to which the answers are:
* **Account number**: VUMC148
* **Building**: MRB4
* **Room**: 7415A
* **What do you want?**: one 50 pound tank of CO<sub>2</sub>

They'll then confirm with an order number and tell you when to expect the tank.  
Usually they have the tank to you within a couple days.

# Plumbing
## Removing/reattaching tubing
### Quick-release fittings
The quick-release fittings are the ones with the little plastic ring around the tube. These are the ones on the tank side, connecting all the red tubing.

To remove the tube, press and hold the plastic ring down onto the metal fitting. While holding it down, pull the tube out with the other hand. It may stick a little, but that's normal.

To reattach the tube, just insert the tube into the fitting and press firmly in. It should go about 1/2-inch into the fitting.

### Regular fittings
The regular fittings are the ones that look like a threaded metal cone, and the tube just fits over the end of the cone part.

To remove, just pull until it comes off. These can be pretty tough to remove. If it seems like it's going to be too much trouble to get it off, cut a slit in the tubing against the fitting with a razor blade until the tubing can be removed easily.

To reattach, push the tubing onto the fitting. If the tubing is too brittle to fit over the fitting, replace the tubing.

## Replacing parts

You probably won't have to do any replacements, but just in case, here's how I put it all together.

If you remove any of these fittings, you should replace the teflon tape around the threads before putting it back together. This will make it easier to tighten and prevent it from seizing so it will remain easy to remove in the future.

Just take the teflon tape and stretch it once around the threads of the fitting, as pictured.

### Tank side

* The **tank regulator** fitting is 1/4-inch MNPT (male National Pipe Thread).
* The [**coupling**](https://www.grainger.com/product/GRAINGER-APPROVED-Brass-Coupling-46M499) is 1/4-inch FNPT (female National Pipe Thread) on both sides.
* The [**adapter**](https://www.grainger.com/product/SMC-1-4-Brass-Male-Adapter-36X027) is 1/4-inch MNPT on the metal side, and on the tubing side it accepts 1/4-inch OD (outer diameter) tubing.
* The [**tubing**](https://www.grainger.com/product/GRAINGER-APPROVED-50-ft-Extruded-Polyurethane-2LZF8) is polyurethane, 1/4-inch OD, and 5/32-inch ID (inner diameter).
