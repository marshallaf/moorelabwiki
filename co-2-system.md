<!-- TITLE: CO2 System -->

The CO<sub>2</sub> system supplies the [incubator](/incubator-system "Incubator System") with carbon dioxide. Cells grown in the incubator need the media to be kept at an optimal pH (around 7). Typically media contains dissolved bicarbonate (HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>) in order to maintain this pH, but at normal air concentrations of CO<sub>2</sub>, the bicarbonate would dissociate to H<sub>2</sub>O and CO<sub>2</sub>, and evaporate into the air. Therefore, in order to keep the media at the correct pH, the atmosphere in the incubator is kept at 5% CO<sub>2</sub> to keep the bicarbonate in solution.
# Ordering replacement tanks
When one of the tanks has run out, you'll need to order a replacement.

We rely on **A&L Compressed Gas** for our CO<sub>2</sub>.  
>A&L Compressed Gas  
>615.254.1457

Call them and tell them you are calling from Vanderbilt University and that you need to order a CO<sub>2</sub> tank.

They commonly ask several questions, to which the answers are:
* **Account number**: VUMC148
* **Building**: MRB4
* **Room**: 7415A
* **What do you want?**: one 50 pound tank of CO<sub>2</sub>

They'll then confirm with an order number and tell you when to expect the tank.  
Usually they have the tank to you within a couple days.
