# Ordering replacement tanks
When one of the tanks has run out, you'll need to order a replacement.

We rely on **A&L Compressed Gas** for our CO<sub>2</sub>.  
>A&L Compressed Gas
>615.254.1457

Call them and tell them you are calling from Vanderbilt University and that you need to order a CO<sub>2</sub> tank.

They commonly ask several questions, to which the answers are:
* **Account number**: VUMC148
* **Building**: MRB4
* **Room**: 7415A
* **What do you want?**: one 50 pound tank of CO<sub>2</sub>

They'll then confirm with an order number and tell you when to expect the tank.  
Usually they have the tank to you within a couple days.
