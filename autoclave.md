<!-- TITLE: Autoclave -->

The **autoclave** is a machine that uses high temperature and pressure to sterilize materials. We often use it to sterilize equipment for use in [animal procedures](/mouses/procedures).

It has 2 types of cycle: gravity and liquid. Gravity is used for solid items like tools and flasks, and liquid is used for liquid items like flasks filled with water or broth.
# Autoclaving tools
### Loading the autoclave

Place tools in autoclave sleeves. I usually place one per sleeve.

Place sleeves with tools into a metal basket. This makes it easier to remove them from the autoclave.

Go into the autoclave room (room 7414) just outside the main lab door.

The autoclaves are the two machines just before you get to the ice machine.

Each autoclave has a foot pedal at the bottom-right corner. Press this pedal to open the door. 

Place the metal basket into the autoclave. Avoid touching the sides of the autoclave because they can be hot. Press the foot pedal again to close the door.

On the display screen, press **CYCLE SELECT**.

Press **1. GRAVITY**. This selects the shortest gravity cycle (15 min).

Press **START CYCLE**. This starts the cycle. A countdown timer should appear showing the estimated time until the cycle is complete.

Write your name down in the appropriate log book on the table opposite the autoclaves. Autoclave #2 is the one closest to the ice machine.

### Unloading the autoclave

When the autoclave is finished, press the foot pedal to open the door.

Wearing a hot glove, carefully remove the metal basket from the autoclave. The inside of the autoclave is *very* hot, so be careful. Press the foot pedal to close the door.

Take the basket back into lab and wait for it to cool.

When the basket and tools are cool enough, label all the bags with the date.
