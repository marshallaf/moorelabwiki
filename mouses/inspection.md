<!-- TITLE: Mouse Inspection -->

**Mouse inspection** happens every six months (in January and July) and is how Vanderbilt DAC makes sure the animal labs at Vanderbilt maintain compliance with the regulations set out by the American Association for Laboratory Animal Care (AALAC).

AALAC inspects labs at Vanderbilt about once every 3 years, so the semi-annual inspections are to keep labs ready for the AALAC inspection.

# Regulations
## Non-survival procedures
The majority of our procedures are non-survival; in other words, after the procedure is over, the mouse is dead. These are things like harvesting the spleen or bone marrow. 

For non-survival procedures, the rules revolve mostly around where and how the animal is terminated. 

We do all of our sac procedures in a glass jar with isoflurane. 

In order to sacrifice the animal in an AALAC-approved humane manner, the following steps must be followed:
1. Start with a clean jar. The jar must have been cleaned since it was last used to sac a mouse.
2. Place a gauze square in the bottom of the jar. Working in the fume hood, transfer a small amount of isoflurane to the gauze with an eyedropper.
3. Place a plastic barrier on top of the isoflurane-soaked gauze. We normally use the insert from a pipette box, cut to fit into the jar.
4. Place another gauze square on top of the barrier.
5. Place the mouse inside and close the lid.
6. Wait until the mouse has completely stopped breathing, then remove it and perform cervical dislocation to confirm death.

Repeat this process for additional mice.
