<!-- TITLE: Cage Cards -->

# Cage cards
These cards uniquely identify the cage and other associated information.

## How we use the cage cards
We use the cage cards to identify the mice in that cage. 

As such, when writing a cage card, usually the following information should be included:
* **Strain**: the strain of the mice.
  * This is the most important. Many of our strains of mice look exactly the same physically, so it is important to mark the strain of mouse on the cage card so different strains do not get mixed up accidentally.
* **Age**: the age of the mice.
