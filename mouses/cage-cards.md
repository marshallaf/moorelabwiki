<!-- TITLE: Cage Cards -->

# Cage cards
These cards uniquely identify the cage and other associated information.

## How we use the cage cards
We use the cage cards to identify the mice in that cage. 

As such, when writing a cage card, we usually include the following information:
* **Strain**: the strain of the mice.
  * This is the most important. Many of our strains of mice look exactly the same physically, so it is important to mark the strain of mouse on the cage card so different strains do not get mixed up accidentally.
* **Age**: the age of the mice.
  * We often keep mice born on the same or similar days in the same cage, so this age applies to all the mice in the cage.
  * This could be left blank if the ages are different, not important, or identified via another method (i.e. ear tag).
* **Sex**: the sex of the mice.
* **Number of mice**: this is what those boxes mean. For ease of census-taking, we mark usage of mice in the cage by putting an X in a box when we remove a mouse. The number of open boxes is how many mice remain in the cage.

Here's a typical cage card:


### Activating cage cards
You'll notice in the above picture the barcode tabs on the top and bottom of the card. 

When you activate a new cage card, you must indicate on the bottom tab how many mice are being added *to the colony*.  Note that this means if you are weaning mice from a breeding cage, write the number of mice that you are adding to the cage. However, if you are moving mice from a pre-existing cage into a new cage, write 0 as the number on the activation tab, since no new mice are being added to the overall colony.

Place the tab in the plastic sleeve on the outside of the suite door.

### Deactivating cage cards
When you need to deactivate a cage card (because you are taking the mice back to lab for experiments, sacking the mice, or replacing the card), simply tear off the top slip of the card and place it in the plastic sleeve on the outside of the suite door.

## How DAC uses the cage cards
DAC scans all of the cage cards in the mouse room *weekly* to confirm their census for billing us. However, they scan all of the tear-off barcode tabs placed in the pocket on the mouse room door *daily* to activate new cages or sacking old ones. Therefore, to avoid continuing charges on cages that you have deactivated, remember to leave the deactivating barcode in the pocket on the door before you leave the mouse room.
