<!-- TITLE: Genotyping -->

**Genotyping** is the procedure that we use to determine the DNA genotype of mice. 

For most transgenic and knockout mice that we use, there is not a readily observable phenotype that indicates the genotype of the mouse. Therefore, we must use genotyping to absolutely confirm the genotype of any non-true-breeding offspring.

# Collecting tissue
**Required items**
* PCR tubes, 8-tube strip, with individually attached lids ()
* Scissors
* Ear tags ()
* Ear tag appliers
* Sharpie to label tubes

**Collection**  

Label the tube strips with letters (A, B...) on one of the ends of the strip. This will be the tube 1 in that strip; the final tube is tube 8.

In the mouse room hood, place a cage with mice to genotype. Place an ear tag on each of the mice. 

Using the scissors, cut a small bit of the end of the tail off and place it into one of the tubes in the strip. You only need to get about 1-2 mm of tail.

Close the lid of the tube that you placed the tail in. Write down the ear tag number of the mouse and the tube number that you put the tail in so that you can match genotypes to mice when you are finished genotyping.

Repeat this process for all the mice you need genotyped. Bring your tubes with tail clippings back to lab.

For some PCR protocols, the dirty prep does not amplify reliably. For these, you have to use
