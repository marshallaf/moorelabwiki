# B6
# NOD
# C3H
# NOD.uMT
# NOD.RAG-/-
# SLE123
# B6.IL15-/-
These mice are double knockouts for the IL15 (interleukin-15) gene, on a B6 background.

## Production
Mice of this genotype are true breeding.

## Genotyping
This protocol is also used to genotype the IL15 portion of the SAP-/- IL15-/- mice below.

### Primers
**IL15 F**: 5’ CAC TTC AGA GGC ATG TCG GT 3’ (20bp) - interleukin 15 isoform X1  
**IL15 R**: 5’ TAC AAG GGC TGT TCG TTG CT 3’ (20bp) - interleukin 15 isoform X1

### PCR Mix
Reagent | Amount (per rxn) | Stock Conc. | Final Conc.
--- | --- | --- | ---
IL15 F Primer | 1.5 ul | 10 uM | 0.6 uM
IL15 R Primer | 1.5 ul | 10 uM | 0.6 uM
Promega Green Mix | 12.5 ul | 2X | 1X
Nuclease-free water | 7.5 ul | - | -

### Expected result
**Bands**:  
* wild-type: ~846 bp
* IL15-/-: no band
# B6.SAP-/-
These mice are double knockouts for the SAP (SLAM-associated protein) gene, on a B6 background.

## Production
We are not actively maintaining this strain.

This strain can be purchased from [Jackson, stock number 025754](https://www.jax.org/strain/025754).

## Genotyping
This protocol can only be used with [clean DNA](/mouses/genotyping) prepared using a kit like the [QIAGEN DNeasy Blood & Tissue kit](https://www.qiagen.com/us/shop/sample-technologies/dna/genomic-dna/dneasy-blood-and-tissue-kit/#orderinginformation). It will not work with DNA prepared from NaOH-digested tissue.

This protocol is also used to genotype the SAP portion of the SAP-/- IL15-/- mice below.

### Primers
**SAP F**: 5’ CTC TCT GCA TCC TTC TCA CAT 3’ (21bp) - SH2 domain-containing protein 1A  
**SAP R**: 5’ GCC AGA GGA CTT TTC AAC TGG 3’ (21bp) - SAP gene  
**PFred**: 5’ CAT GCC GTT TCA TAT GAT CCG GG 3’ (23bp) - ? i don’t know what this is, but it does something

# Qa1-/-
These mice are double knockouts for the Qa-1 gene, on a B6 background.
# B6.VH125+/+
These mice have V<sub>H</sub>125 inserted into both copies of the genome, on a B6 background.

This mouse produces B-cells that produce anti-insulin antibodies.

This mouse has an anti-insulin gene (V<sub>H</sub>125) inserted, replacing the endogenous IgJ<sub>H</sub>3 allele. Because it is site-directed to the native IgJ<sub>H</sub>3, these B-cells are able to class switch and produce both IgM<sup>a</sup> and IgD<sup>a</sup> (as opposed to only IgMa in non-site-directed V<sub>H</sub>125Tg mice).

## Production
This strain is maintained by breeding B6.VH125+/+ mice with each other. 

It can also be achieved by breeding B6.VH125+/- mice with each other, then genotyping the pups with both protocols shown below to select the +/+ genotype.

## Genotyping VH125
This protocol confirms the presence of one *or* two copies of the VH125 allele. To confirm homozygosity, the mice must also be genotyped using the JH3 protocol below.

## Genotyping wild-type insertion site (JH3)



# B6.Vk125+/+
# B6.VH+/+Vk+/+
# NOD.VH125+/+
Ideally, these mice would have V<sub>H</sub>125 inserted into both copies of the genome, on a NOD background.

However, to date, we've been unable to produce homozygous-positive mice, and therefore are stuck with heterozygotes (VH125+/-).

## Genotyping
The genotyping protocol is the same as the the B6.VH125+/+ protocol above.
# NOD.Vk125+/+
These mice have
