<!-- TITLE: Sending packages -->

Occasionally, you'll have to send a package. 

# Regular package
### Preparing the package

First, you'll need to find a Fedex US Airbill label. These labels are usually at the Fedex dropoff site. 

The most convenient one is just inside the main entrance to MCN. It's a large orange, purple, and white metal box, and is often half-buried in shipments waiting for pickup. Open the top door to find a bunch of slots where different Fedex forms are stored. 

If there are none there, there is another 



# Dry ice
For packages that contain dry ice, you need one additional label to place on the package. 

They are white square stickers with bold black lines in a diamond shape. They look like this:

These labels are usually in the same place as the Fedex dropoff, but if there are none there, you can also find a roll of them on the 7th floor of Light Hall, on a table just outside the elevators.

Fill out the sections with the appropriate addresses, and mark the weight of dry ice in kilograms.

For small packages, you can weigh the package on the scale before the dry ice is added, and then again after to figure out how many kilograms there are.

You can also estimate the kilograms of dry ice based on the volume of the box. There is approximately 0.026 kg per cubic inch of dry ice.
