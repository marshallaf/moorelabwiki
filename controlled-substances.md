<!-- TITLE: Controlled Substances -->
*This page current as of 21 June 2017.*

For anesthetizing mice during surgery and some other procedures, we use ketamine. Ketamine is a DEA controlled substance in Schedule 3.

Since it is a controlled substance, there are some special considerations regarding its procurement, storage, usage, and disposal.

Currently, we do not use any other controlled substances, but if we start using another one, the procedures listed on this page will most likely apply to that substance as well.
