<!-- TITLE: Controlled Substances -->
*This page current as of 21 June 2017.*

For anesthetizing mice during surgery and some other procedures, we use ketamine. Ketamine is a DEA controlled substance in Schedule 3.

Since it is a controlled substance, there are some special considerations regarding its procurement, storage, usage, and disposal.

Currently, we do not use any other controlled substances, but if we start using another one, the procedures listed on this page will most likely apply to that substance as well.

# Procurement
Just make a regular requisition in eProcurement for a purchase from Patterson Veterinary Supply, for [KetaVed 100 mg/mL, 10 mL](https://www.pattersonvet.com/ProductItem/078908598).

The only differences from a normal requisition are:  
* In the **Comment for Supplier** field, put in "Dr. Daniel Moore, account number [number]."
* When it asks if HIPAA is applicable to this purchase, select "No".
