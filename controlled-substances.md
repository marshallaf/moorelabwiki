<!-- TITLE: Controlled Substances -->
*This page current as of 21 June 2017.*

For anesthetizing mice during surgery and some other procedures, we use ketamine. Ketamine is a DEA controlled substance in Schedule 3.

Since it is a controlled substance, there are some special considerations regarding its procurement, storage, usage, and disposal.

Currently, we do not use any other controlled substances, but if we start using another one, the procedures listed on this page will most likely apply to that substance as well.

# Procurement
Just make a regular requisition in eProcurement for a purchase from Patterson Veterinary Supply, for [KetaVed 100 mg/mL, 10 mL](https://www.pattersonvet.com/ProductItem/078908598).

The only differences from a normal requisition are:  
* In the **Comment for Supplier** field, put in "Dr. Daniel Moore, account number [number]."
* When it asks if HIPAA is applicable to this purchase, select "No".
# Storage
Any vial with ketamine in it must be kept in a locked box, in a locked drawer.

We have two lockboxes, one for fresh drugs, and the other for drugs that are expired or used up. It is recommended to keep expired drugs in the separate box until they are disposed so that they are less likely to be accidentally used on mice.

All drugs and drug mixtures - anything that will be used in survival procedures - must have the correct expiration date clearly marked on the outside of the container. The expiration date of a drug mixture (e.g. ketamine + saline) is the earliest expiration date between the two. For example, if the ketamine expires on 28 Feb 2019 and the saline expires on 30 Nov 2018, the expiration date of the mixture is 30 Nov 2018.
