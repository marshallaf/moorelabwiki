<!-- TITLE: -80&deg; Freezer -->

Our -80&deg; freezer is where we store stuff that needs to be real cold.

It's pretty low maintenance, but here's some things that might come up.
# Monitoring service
The freezer is connected to a monitoring service that is run by the Delta Operations Center, at Vanderbilt Plant Services.

If the alarm goes off, they will be alerted. They will come check out the freezer and call the contact person (you) if something is amiss.

If the alarm goes off, but you already know about it and it's not anything to worry about (like you had the door open for a while, so the temperature rise is normal), call the peeps at Delta Ops.
