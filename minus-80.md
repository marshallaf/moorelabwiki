<!-- TITLE: Minus 80 Freezer -->

Our -80&deg;C freezer is where we store stuff that needs to be real cold.

It's pretty low maintenance, but here's some things that might come up.
# Monitoring service
The freezer is connected to a monitoring service that is run by the Delta Operations Center, at Vanderbilt Plant Services.

If the alarm goes off, they will be alerted. They will come check out the freezer and call the contact person (you) if something is amiss.

If the alarm goes off, but you already know about it and it's not anything to worry about (like you had the door open for a while, so the temperature rise is normal), call the peeps at Delta Ops.

# Troubleshooting
## The door won't open
The freezer has a vacuum system that starts after you close the door. This vacuum should exist shortly after closing the door, but should vent fairly quickly. 

If it still cannot be opened after a minute or so, the vent is probably frozen over.

The vent is located on the left side of the freezer, at the top near the front. 

Ice on the inside that is clogging the vent can be broken off by pressing in firmly on the plunger on the vent. This should vent the vacuum and allow the door to be opened again.

## The alarm is going off
The freezer will begin sounding an alarm if it heats up above a set threshold (75&deg;C).

If this is expected, because the door has been open for a bit or something reasonable like that, then press the **Silence alarm** button on the control panel and call the Monitoring Service as outlined above.

If this is not expected, and the freezer continues to heat up, something is wrong. Continue to **The freezer is heating up** below.
