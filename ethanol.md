<!-- TITLE: Ethanol -->

# Buying ethanol
For some reason, buying lab-grade ethanol is extremely expensive from the normal suppliers, so we have to buy it directly from Vanderbilt Medical Center.

You can only purchase it from Vanderbilt from 2pm-3pm on Tuesdays and Thursdays, so be sure to get the 1180 before then.
 
## 1180 form
The first thing you’ll need to do is get an 1180 Requisition Form from the [Peds Endo administrative assistant](/admin-asst "Adminstrative Assistants").  Shoot him/her an email about this, including the following information:
* **Units ordered**: 4
* **Unit of issue**: gallon
* **Description**: 100% lab-grade ethanol, 4x1 gallon bottles
* **Amount**: the price - this fluctuates, but it's usually around 40. I think they can leave it blank and you can write it in when you get the ethanol.
* **Center Number**: the center number you'd like to charge the purchase to.

The administrative assistant will email you when the 1180 is approved and ready to pick up. Go to VAV and get it.

The 1180 should look something like the below picture when you get it. It will be 3 carbon copies (yellow, pink, white).

## Getting to the vendor
Again, the place is only open from 2pm-3pm on Tuesdays and Thursdays, so don't bother trekking all the way over there if it's not the right time.

You may want to bring a cart to transport the box. 4 gallons of ethanol weighs about 25 lbs, so you probably don't want to carry that all the way back to the lab.

There are two routes to get to the vendor: outside and inside.

### Outside route
 
Walk out of Light Hall following the purple line:

Behind Robinson and Preston there’s a loading dock - this is where you’re going.  Head to the far end of the loading dock and go behind the large green dumpster.

You’ll see a small set of stairs and a door.  Go through the door.

Look to the right-ish direction, you’ll see some blue doors at the end of a small hallway.  If Blair is standing there like in the picture, steal *his* box of ethanol.  Otherwise, go to that door on the right.

### Inside route

## The actual transaction

There should be an employee there who will accept your 1180 in exchange for the box of 4 gallons of 100% ethanol. If there isn't, check the small windowed room in the same area. If there isn't anyone there at all, then come back on the next Tuesday or Thursday. It's a highly refined system.

Anyway, if you find someone, they'll have you write the price of the ethanol on the 1180 and sign it. Then they'll keep the top copy of the carbon copies, and you'll keep the other two. Take the 1180 and your ethanol and bring it back to lab.
 
At your convenience, bring the 1180 back to the [Peds Endo administrative assistant](/admin-asst "Adminstrative Assistants").
